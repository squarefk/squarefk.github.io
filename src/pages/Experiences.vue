      .title Tsinghua Graphics and Geometric Computing Group
      .gray-title Student(2016.07 - Present)
      .desc.
        I worked with <a href="http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm">Prof. Shimin Hu</a> and his postdoc <a href="http://miaowang.me/">Dr. Miao Wang</a>, with a focus on deep-learning-based video post-processing. I implemented a novel deep neural network model which outperforms the state of the art. A paper about our work is being written.

      .title  Computer Graphics Group at Penn
      .gray-title Visiting undergraduate student (2017.06 - Present)
      .desc I work with <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cffjiang/" target="_blank">Prof. Chenfanfu Jiang</a> on the Material Point Method(MPM), to effectively and accurately simulate water, rigid bodies. We proposed approaches to solve common issues about MPM (e.g., how to make incompressible liquid simulation divergence free and how to simulate thin-shell objects with coupling). Results will be submitted to SIGGRAPH 2018.

      .title Phantouch
      .gray-title Graphics Engineer internship (2015.08 - 2015.11)
      .desc I interned at Phantouch, a start-up company with a focus on VR research. We built a low-latency VR system from scratch, both software and hardware. Our system was presented as a successful demo for A-round financing. Its user experience (especially latency in graphics) was as excellent as the best product at that time, Oculus and Gear VR.
